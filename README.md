# 🍵 T(EA)racker: The Milk Tea Tracker
The T(EA)racker app is a full-stack application created using React, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.

Milk tea, otherwise known as boba tea, bubble milk tea or boba, is a tea-based drink primarily made of milk, tea, sugar and tapioca pearls. Since the rise in popularity of these drinks many different flavours and mixins (e.g. herbal jelly, custard etc.) have been used to make a variety of milk teas.

Using this app, a user can keep track of various milk tea orders using select drinks from popular milk tea chains including Chatime, Gong cha and ShareTea.
